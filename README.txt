=== USAGE ===
Things you need to run the script: Python 2.7.3
ViewBot supports SOCKS4,SOCKS5 and HTTP proxies.
1.Before you run the script,make sure you the have files: prox.txt and port.txt in the same dir.As you can guess prox.txt contains the IP's and port.txt contains the ports for each proxy (duhh...)
2.Specify what type of proxy you will use on line 52: 'PROXYTYPE_' .By default its SOCKS4.
I recommend to use socks4 for better performance.
IF the script fails at some point remove the bad proxy that caused it to fail,it will tell you the last successfully used proxy.

Enjoy.
